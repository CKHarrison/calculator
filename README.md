# Calculator Web App

Calculator project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator)

This was a fun project to work on, the biggest challenge that I encountered was being able to string together a continuous equation. (62-3+4*99)

In the future I would like to implement the decimal button, and perhaps add in a backspace button.
